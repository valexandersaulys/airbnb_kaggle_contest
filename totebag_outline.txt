Totebag
-------
  * highly efficient way of committee voting in python
  * add an infinite amount of models (all classification)
  * take the most recurring vote

Later:
  * expand to regressive models (like through averaging)
  * ability to take into consideration the probability outputs (don't know how to do)

Basic Idea:
  - Add potential models via .add_model() function
  - this appends them to a list
  - at .fit() time, iterate over the list and fit each model, put back into a new list
  - at .predict() time, iterate over all fitted models in list, get predictions, return most common prediction
